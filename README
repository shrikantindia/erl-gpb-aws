The erlang & rebar3 are required to run the service.

In this task, the server is broadly divided into three kind of tasks -
 - Client-Server interaction - TCP Engine
 - Processing of messages - Handler
 - AWS services interaction - AWS Engine

The client contains API
gpbcl:set_request(<KEY NAME>, <VALUE>)
gpbcl:get_request(<KEY NAME>)

Erlcloud library is used to interact with the AWS service.

Separate README files are present for server and client.
